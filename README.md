# PwC PowerBI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience
## Forage Data Analytics project Powerbi Dashboard Experience
Welcome to the PwC Switzerland Power BI in Data Analytics.

PwC Switzerland envisions strategic and coordinated company-wide implementation of new technology that impacts all employees and existing processes. We aim to build innovative technology solutions that differentiate us from our competitors and digitise the business. Part of that included a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programmes so our people could learn how to use digital tools for data visualisation as well as automation, data cleansing and more.

If our people could use these tools to solve common problems, they’d help us become more efficient and growth-oriented now and more innovative later in Business Services and beyond. Now, employees are learning to build bots – over 2,400 have been created so far – to automate workflows. We continue to invest to make processes more intuitive using machine learning, PowerBI and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). These are key to working faster and solving problems differently for ourselves and our clients.

This is why you're here! Our Digital Accelerator programme is an internal chance that takes groups of our employees out of their day jobs and puts them through trainings that teaches them skills in technology such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is an important part of it as visualising data helps to handle and understand clients.

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

 * Overall customer satisfaction
 * Overall calls answered/abandoned
 * Calls by time
 * Average speed of answer
  # Task 2 : Customer Retention
## Here is the background information on the task
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention. In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned:  we don’t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
* We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section
# Here is the task
Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

* Define proper KPIs
* Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
* Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
# Task 3 : Diversity & Inclusion
## Here is the background information on the task
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help. At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges. Why is this so? Think about the importance of strategy, awareness and education, analytics and inspiration.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

* number of men
* number of women
* number of leavers
* % employees promoted (FY21)
* % of women promoted
* % of hires men
* % of hires women
* % turnover
* Average performance rating: men
* Average Performance rating: women
## Here is the task
Your task is to do the following:

 1. Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation
 2. Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be
